/**
 * World Guardian — DB-intended behavior:
 *   "If you have 24 or more VP, and you are Good, gain 6 VP."
 *
 * This is ENGINE-handled, not effect-system handled. The class `ability` array is
 * intentionally empty. The grant surfaces to the player as a CLEANUP CLAIM card:
 * `enterBenefits` (phases.ts) gates on `awakenedClassCounts['World Guardian'] >= 1 &&
 * !evil && victoryPoints >= 24` and pushes a
 * `{ kind: 'vp', amount: 6, source: 'World Guardian' }` line into
 * `player.pendingAwakenReward.grants`. `resolveAwakenReward` (runtime.ts) applies the
 * +6 VP when the player claims.
 *
 * Alignment: `isEvilAlignment` is `statusLevel >= 3`, so "Good" == `statusLevel < 3`.
 *
 * These tests assert the claim-building behavior through the real engine entry point
 * (`enterBenefits`) — the channel the player actually sees — and guard that nothing is
 * granted silently by the `awakeningPhase` effect trigger (no double-grant). The
 * resolve-side +6 VP gain is exercised by the engine suite (runtime.test.ts /
 * phases.test.ts), which can build a fully-active game state; see the skipped
 * placeholder below for the intended in-file assertion if the resolve path ever becomes
 * reachable from `testHelpers`.
