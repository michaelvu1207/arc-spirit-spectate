// World Ender — DB intent: "In the Awakening Phase, gain 1 VP." Unconditional.
//
// CHANGED: was an all-Evil win-con (+3 VP × players) surfaced as a Cleanup CLAIM
// card (enterCleanup → resolveAwakenReward). Now a flat, unconditional +1 VP in the
// Awakening Phase. Implemented as a bespoke `run` handler on `awakeningPhase` (fires
// once per active player at cleanup, BEFORE findWinner) that mutates the acting
// player's victoryPoints directly and logs a breadcrumb so the gain is observable.
//
// ENGINE FOLLOW-UP (cannot be done in this file): the old World Ender Cleanup claim
// in phases.ts `enterCleanup` must be REMOVED, and World Ender moved out of
// ENGINE_HANDLED_CLASSES (into the handler-coverage path) in coverage.test.ts /
// awaken.test.ts — otherwise the player is granted VP twice. Reported via engineNeeds.
