 * Ancient Magus — "For every unique Relic you hold, reduce incoming damage by 2."
 *
 * Bespoke `onTakeDamage` handler: it counts the UNIQUE relics the player holds
 * (`player.runes` entries with `type === 'relic'`, deduped by `name`) and raises
 * `player.damageReduction` by 2 per unique relic. `takeDamage` later consumes
 * `damageReduction` against the incoming hit, exactly like the declarative
 * `reduceIncomingDamage` action does for Aquamaiden/Firekeeper — so this surfaces
 * as a passive combat number plus a log line.
 *
 * Counting unique relics requires reading `player.runes` (not a fixed amount), so
 * this can't be expressed by the declarative `reduceIncomingDamage` action and is
 * implemented as a `run` handler instead.
