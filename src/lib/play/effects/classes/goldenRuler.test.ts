/**
 * Golden Ruler — DB-intended behavior:
 *   "In the Awakening Phase, gain 1 VP. If you are evil, you must discard this spirit."
 *
 * This is ENGINE-handled, not effect-system handled. The class `ability` array is
 * intentionally empty. The grant surfaces to the player as a CLEANUP CLAIM card:
 * `enterBenefits` (phases.ts) pushes a `{ kind: 'vp', amount: 1, source: 'Golden Ruler' }`
 * line into `player.pendingAwakenReward.grants` whenever the player holds ≥1 awakened
 * Golden Ruler — and, when the player is Evil, it tags the line with a note warning that
 * claiming also discards a Golden Ruler spirit. `resolveAwakenReward` (runtime.ts) then
 * applies the +1 VP and, for Evil claimants, discards one awakened Golden Ruler spirit.
 *
 * These tests assert the claim-building behavior through the real engine entry point
 * (`enterBenefits`) — the channel the player actually sees — and guard that nothing is
 * granted silently by the `awakeningPhase` effect trigger (no double-grant). The
 * resolve-side VP gain + Evil self-discard is exercised by the engine suite
 * (runtime.test.ts / phases.test.ts), which can build a fully-active game state; see the
 * skipped placeholder below for the intended in-file assertion if the resolve path ever
 * becomes reachable from `testHelpers`.
