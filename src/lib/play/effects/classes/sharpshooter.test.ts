/**
 * Sharpshooter — DB-intended behavior (source of truth):
 *   - On summon, gain 1 Enchanted Attack (die).
 *   - Your side may always attack at the same time as the enemy.
 *
 * The summon grant is a declarative `onSpiritSummon` breakpoint, fired through the
 * real dispatcher via `fire()`. Both actions surface to the player as attributed
 * log lines (no silent no-op): "Gained 1 enchanted attack dice." and
 * "You cannot be stunned."
 *
 * The "always attack at the same time" rule lives in combat.ts
 * (`hasSimultaneousAttack`, not exported), which keys directly on the Sharpshooter
 * class count (>= 1) carried by the spirit — independent of the per-combat
 * `stunImmune` flag. That passive is owned by combat.ts, so it is asserted there;
 * here we only verify the summon-time grant that this class file owns.
