/**
 * Adaptive Fighter — declarative `onMonsterKill` ability.
 *
 * DB-intended behavior (source of truth):
 *   - If you overkill by 2 damage, gain 1 potential.
 *   - If you don't kill, gain 1 Enchanted Attack (die).
 *
 * The two outcomes are mutually exclusive in practice (overkill implies a kill;
 * "not killed" implies no overkill), but both branches are exercised here. We fire
 * the real dispatcher (`applyTrigger`) with `combat` info threaded in, because the
 * shared `fire()` helper does not thread combat — and this is a declarative
 * breakpoint class, so there is no `run` handler to unit-test directly.
 *
 * UX channel: every branch surfaces as an attributed combat log line
 * ("Adaptive Fighter: Gained N potential." / "… Gained N enchanted attack dice."),
 * so neither branch is a silent no-op.
