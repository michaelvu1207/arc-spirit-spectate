/**
 * Status-change bookkeeping + the `onStatusChange` trigger.
 *
 * Whenever a player's `statusLevel` changes — the corruption ladder in
 * `combat.ts takeDamage`, or a manual `adjustStatus` in the runtime — this helper
 * records which corruption thresholds were crossed THIS round (so the Awakening
 * Phase, folded into cleanup, can grant the status-driven class effects exactly
 * once) and fires the `onStatusChange` trigger so any immediate class reaction
 * runs.
 *
 * The threshold flags are engine bookkeeping (they apply regardless of class), so
 * they're set here at the single dispatch point rather than in a class handler.
 * They are reset at the start of each round in `beginNavigation`. `corruptedThisRound`
 * marks any upward status move (The Corruptor); the per-stage `became*` flags mark
 * the specific stage entered (Cursed Spirit's per-stage grants).

 *
 * Flags are sticky for the round (set, never cleared here) so a player who passes
 * through Tainted on the way to Corrupt records BOTH — each `became*` reflects
 * "you entered this stage this round", which is what the Awakening-Phase grants key
