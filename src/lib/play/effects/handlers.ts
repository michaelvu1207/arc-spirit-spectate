/**
 * Handler-table escape hatch for irreducibly bespoke class effects.
 *
 * The declarative `CLASS_EFFECTS` registry covers most classes, but a handful
 * express logic that can't be reduced to data-only `EffectAction`s — they branch
 * on live state (barrier parity, opponent initiative), mutate the spirit list, or
 * defer a "may" choice to the player. Those closures are authored alongside their
 * declarative siblings in the canonical {@link CLASS_ABILITIES} source; this file
 * DERIVES the legacy `CLASS_HANDLERS` table (and `HANDLER_CLASSES`) from it so
 * every existing import keeps working unchanged.
 *
 * `applyTrigger` runs the declarative breakpoints FIRST, then any matching handler
 * here, so a class can use both paths (none currently do, but the order is fixed).
 * Each handler receives the same {@link EffectContext} the declarative path uses
 * and mutates `ctx.player` / `ctx.state` in place. Determinism: any randomness must
 * flow through `ctx.state.rng`; these handlers use none directly (the only "random"
 * piece — Dark Fighter's optional reroll — is deferred to a manual prompt).
