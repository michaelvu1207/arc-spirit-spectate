/**
 * Display-only combat/encounter log collapsing.
 *
 * The engine emits one log line per granted effect, each attributed to its source
 * trait (e.g. "Spirit Animal: Gained +1 combat damage." / "Spirit Animal: Gained 1
 * initiative."). When one source grants several numeric buffs in a row that reads as
 * a wall of near-duplicate lines. This merges CONSECUTIVE lines from the same source
 * into a single sentence, summing each distinct effect:
 *
 *   Spirit Animal: Gained +1 combat damage.
 *   Spirit Animal: Gained 1 initiative.
 *   Spirit Animal: Gained +2 combat damage.
 *   Spirit Animal: Gained 2 initiative.
 *      →  Spirit Animal: Gained +3 combat damage and 3 initiative.
 *
 * Purely cosmetic — the engine log is untouched; only the UI renders the merged view.
